# calculator
This project is a simple calculator web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface consists of a table with buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), as well as a clear button (C) and an equals button (=) to compute the result. The calculator input and result are displayed in a text field. The calculator is styled using CSS for a visually appealing layout, and the functionality is implemented with JavaScript to handle user inputs and perform calculations.
